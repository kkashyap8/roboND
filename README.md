# Udacity Robotics Nanodegree
Introduction : This projct "Home Service Robot" is developed and simulated as fully autonomous robot, which when recieves pick up zone and drop off zone's (x,y) coordinate via command line,
starts localizing and navigating itself on a given map using Adaptive Montecarlo localization(one of Probalistic localization approach) and navigating to goal by planning a global plan based on Grid-based Dijkstra's algorithm and avoiding obstacle and course correction by local planner which used Dynamic Window Approach (DWA).
